                        <div>
                            <p>Transformers is a series of American science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise, which began in the 1980s.[note 1] Michael Bay directed the first five films: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017),[1][2][3] and has served as a producer for subsequent films. A spin-off film Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight and produced by Bay, was released on December 21, 2018. A seventh film, Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr., is to be released in 2023.</p>
                        
                            <p>The series has been distributed by Paramount Pictures and, for the first two films, DreamWorks Pictures. The original Transformers series has received negative to mixed reception, except for Bumblebee, which received positive reviews. It is the 13th-highest-grossing film series, with a total of $4.8 billion; two films in the series have grossed over $1 billion each.</p>

                        <div><p>In 1995, the film "Bad Guys" and "The Rock" (1996) received favorable reviews for their story reviews, and "Armageddon" (1998) was popular worldwide, but received mixed reviews. Since then, "Jin Ju-man" (2001) has also been successful, but its reviews have been mixed and it has been poorly recognized as a director. Since then, the 2005 film "Ireland" has been a huge box office failure. Since 2007, he has directed the "Transformers" live-action film series, and has directed four episodes of the series. He won the Best Picture Award for "Transformers" at the 2008 MTV Film Festival and founded the film company Platinum Dune.</p></div>
